## THEORY:
The circuit shows an inverting comparator with positive feedback. This circuit converts irregular shaped wave forms to a square wave or pulse. The circuit is known as the Schmitt trigger (or) squaring circuit. The input voltage Vin changes the state of the output Vo every time it exceeds certain voltage levels called the upper threshold voltage VUT and lower threshold voltage VLT.
When Vo= - Vsat, the voltage across R1 is referred to as lower threshold voltage, VLT. When Vo=+Vsat, the voltage across R1 is referred to as upper threshold voltage VUT. The comparator with positive feedback is said to exhibit hysteresis, a dead band condition.

## PROCEDURE:
1. Design the value of circuit components and select VUT & VLT as given in the design procedure.
2. Connect the circuit as shown in the circuit diagram.
3. Apply the input signal to the input terminal of op-amp & set VUT & VLT values.
4. Note down the readings from the output waveform.
5. Plot the graph & show the relationship between Input sine wave & Output
