## THEORY:

INTEGRATOR 
 
A circuit in which the output voltage waveform is the integral of the input voltage 
waveform is the integrator. Such a circuit is obtained by using a basic inverting amplifier 
configuration if the feedback resistor Rf is  replaced by a capacitor Cf .  The expression for the 
output voltage is given as, 

Vo = - (1/Rf C1 ) ∫ Vi dt 
 
Here the negative sign indicates that the output voltage is 180 0 out of phase with the 
input signal. Normally between fa and fb the circuit acts as an integrator. Generally, the value of 
fa < fb . The input signal will be integrated properly if the Time period T of the signal is larger 
than or equal to Rf Cf .

That is, T ≥ Rf Cf 
 
The integrator is most commonly used in analog computers and ADC and signal-wave 
shaping circuits.


## DESIGN
~~~
To obtain the output of an Integrator circuit with component values R1Cf = 0.1ms , Rf = 10 
R1 and Cf = 0.01 µF and also if 1 V peak square wave at 1000Hz is applied as input. 
We know the frequency at which the gain is 0 dB, fb = 1 / (2π R1 Cf) Therefore fb =    
Since fb = 10 fa , and also the gain limiting frequency fa = 1 / (2π Rf Cf) 
We get , R1 =  and hence Rf =

## PROCEDURE:

1. Connections are given as per the circuit diagram 
2. + Vcc and - Vcc supply is given to the power supply terminal of the Op-Amp IC. 
3. By adjusting the amplitude and frequency knobs of the function generator, appropriate 
input voltage is applied to the inverting input terminal of the Op- Amp. 
4. The output voltage is obtained in the CRO and the input and output voltage waveforms 
are plotted in a graph sheet.
